# cmatrix

This is intended to be a small and light matrix lib in c, the structure has been constructed and some of the chief function has been completed, see the matrix.h head file to overview the motions, later, a flow-graph will be pushed, count on it.

Any new idea or suggestion will be welcomed, just add it on matrix.h with annotations of descripton.
